# API Connection and Due Assignment Fixes Summary

## Completed Work

1. **API Connection Testing**

   - Created a TestApiConnection component that tests various API endpoints
   - Added health check endpoint to the test list
   - Enhanced UI with retry button, timestamps, and detailed connection info
   - Added the test page to the sidebar navigation for admin users
   - Added due assignment testing feature to directly test the duplicate key fix
   - Implemented request retry mechanism with exponential backoff
   - Added detailed network error detection and reporting
   - Added network statistics section to the test UI

2. **Due Assignment Fixes**

   - Fixed the duplicate key error (E11000) in dues assignment by:
     - Changed `assignDueToPharmacy` method to use `findOneAndUpdate` with `upsert: true`
     - Updated the `bulkAssignDues` method to use the same pattern
     - Added better error handling for when duplicates are attempted
     - Applied the same fix to recurring due creation
     - Enhanced error handling and reporting for duplicate attempts

3. **Connectivity Verification**
   - Created `check-api-connection.sh` script to verify connectivity
   - Created `periodic-api-check.sh` for ongoing monitoring with alerts
   - Fixed Vite proxy configuration for API requests
   - Improved error handling for network errors in the API client

## Current Status

The API connection between the frontend and backend is now working correctly. The TestApiConnection component shows real-time test results for all API endpoints. The due assignment controllers have been fixed to prevent duplicate key errors. A new testing interface has been added to allow directly testing the due assignment fix by intentionally assigning the same due multiple times.

The recurring dues feature has also been fixed to use the same upsert pattern, preventing potential duplicate key errors when creating future recurring dues.

## Testing the Due Assignment Fix

1. Navigate to the TestApiConnection page at `/test-api`
2. Click "Show" in the "Test Due Assignment Fix" section
3. Select a pharmacy and due type
4. Set the amount and due date
5. Click "Assign Due to Pharmacy"
6. Without changing any fields, click "Assign Due to Pharmacy" again
7. Previously this would have caused an E11000 duplicate key error
8. Now it should succeed and update the existing due record

## Monitoring API Connectivity

A new script has been created to monitor API connectivity on an ongoing basis:

```bash
./periodic-api-check.sh --interval=300 --log=api-connection-log.txt --alert
```

This script:

- Checks the API health endpoint every 5 minutes (configurable)
- Logs all connection attempts and results
- Provides alerts after consecutive failures (if --alert is enabled)
- Uses a retry mechanism to handle temporary connectivity issues
- Maintains statistics on uptime and connection reliability

## Next Steps

1. **Test with Real Data**

   - Use the TestApiConnection page to verify all endpoints are working
   - Use the Due Assignment Test feature to verify the fixes work
   - Verify bulk due assignment also works correctly

2. **Additional Improvements**

   - Consider implementing a dashboard for API status monitoring
   - Add more detailed logging for API transactions
   - Set up automated alert notifications for connectivity issues

3. **Documentation**
   - Document the changes made to the API connection
   - Add comments to the code explaining the upsert pattern in due controllers
   - Update any technical documentation to reflect these changes

## Notes for Testing

- The TestApiConnection page is available at: http://localhost:5173/test-api
- It will show the status of various API endpoints
- Admin users can access it from the sidebar under the "UTILITIES" section
- The health check endpoint at `/api/health-check` can be used as a basic test
- Use the periodic-api-check.sh script for long-term connectivity monitoring

## Authentication Note

When testing, make sure to use valid credentials. The test script attempted to use:

- Email: admin@example.com
- Password: password123

If these aren't the correct credentials, update the test script with the proper admin credentials.

## Network Troubleshooting

If you encounter API connection issues:

1. Check that both frontend and backend servers are running
2. Verify the proxy configuration in vite.config.ts
3. Check the backend logs for any error messages
4. Run the check-api-connection.sh script to test basic connectivity
5. Use the TestApiConnection page to test individual endpoints
6. Check browser developer tools for any CORS or network errors

   - Implement periodic connectivity checks

7. **Documentation**
   - Document the changes made to the API connection
   - Add comments to the code explaining the upsert pattern in due controllers
   - Update any technical documentation to reflect these changes

## Notes for Testing

- The TestApiConnection page is available at: http://localhost:5173/test-api

## Authentication Note

If these aren't the correct credentials, update the test script with the proper admin credentials.
